# Resume Bullet Points – Automation Framework Experience

Below are professional, interview‑ready resume bullet points derived from this automation framework implementation.

---

## Core Framework Highlights

- Designed and implemented a **hybrid automation framework** supporting both UI and API testing using **Selenium, RestAssured, Java, Cucumber BDD, and TestNG**.
- Developed a **scalable, modular, and reusable test automation architecture** following industry best practices.
- Automated end‑to‑end business workflows covering UI flows and backend API validations within a single framework.

---

## BDD & Test Automation

- Implemented **Cucumber BDD framework** with Gherkin feature files to enable business‑readable test scenarios.
- Created reusable and maintainable **step definitions** aligned with business requirements.
- Enabled **data‑driven testing** using Scenario Outline, CSV, JSON, and Excel (Apache POI).

---

## Dependency Injection & Context Sharing

- Implemented **constructor‑based dependency injection** to share data between step definition classes.
- Utilized **ScenarioContext** to pass dynamic data such as tokens, IDs, and API responses across steps.
- Eliminated static variables and ensured **parallel execution safety**.

---

## API Automation Expertise

- Built robust API automation layer using **RestAssured** with reusable RequestBuilder and ResponseValidator components.
- Implemented API validations including:
  - Status code verification  
  - JSON schema validation  
  - Response time checks  
  - Data integrity assertions  
- Automated complex API workflows and chaining between multiple services.

---

## UI Automation Design

- Implemented **Page Object Model (POM)** for UI automation using Selenium WebDriver.
- Created centralized **DriverFactory** for browser management and cross‑browser execution.
- Developed reusable UI utilities such as WaitFactory, BasePage, and common action libraries.

---

## Utilities & Framework Enhancements

- Developed custom utilities for:
  - Excel, CSV, and JSON data handling  
  - Dynamic test data generation using Faker  
  - Logging using Log4j  
  - Database validations  
  - Accessibility and visual testing  
- Integrated retry mechanisms and smart waits to improve test stability.

---

## CI/CD & DevOps Integration

- Integrated automation framework with **Jenkins and Azure DevOps pipelines** for continuous testing.
- Configured **Docker and Docker Compose** for containerized test execution.
- Enabled scheduled and on‑demand executions via Maven commands.

---

## Reporting & Monitoring

- Implemented advanced reporting using **Allure and Extent Reports**.
- Configured detailed logs, screenshots, and execution analytics.
- Provided traceable and actionable automation reports for stakeholders.

---

## OOPs & Design Patterns

- Applied OOPs principles such as:
  - Encapsulation  
  - Abstraction  
  - Inheritance  
  - Polymorphism  
- Used design patterns including:
  - Page Object Model  
  - Factory Pattern  
  - Builder Pattern  
  - Dependency Injection  

---

## Achievements

- Reduced manual regression effort by implementing reliable automated regression suites.
- Improved test execution time through parallel execution and API‑first automation.
- Increased automation coverage across UI and backend layers.

---

### Summary Statement for Resume

- Developed an enterprise‑grade automation framework combining Selenium UI, RestAssured API, and Cucumber BDD with full CI/CD integration, enabling scalable, maintainable, and data‑driven test automation.
